## üóûÔ∏è What is ClueTheTimes?

ClueTheTimes is more than a game ‚Äî it's a real-time knowledge system that turns global news into structured, playable intelligence. Built on top of the Sonar API, it showcases how language models can:

- Parse and extract **contextual meaning** from live news content
- Generate **concise, semantically accurate clues**
- Categorize information across domains like politics, economics, and technology
- Automatically convert unstructured knowledge into a structured, human-friendly experience  

Each time you play, you get a fresh, relevant, and educational word search puzzle based on what‚Äôs happening in the world ‚Äî right now.

## üß† How It Works

1. User calls the **Perplexity Sonar API** to retrieve trending news topics.
2. Sonar returns:
   - A list of **keywords** (used as the hidden words in the puzzle)
   - A **clue** for each word (displayed as a hint)
   - A short **explanation** of the news context
   - A **category** (e.g., *political*, *economic*, etc.)
3. The game dynamically:
   - Builds a playable word search grid with the keywords
   - Links each word to its clue and explanation
   - Difficulty levels increase after every win
