## üß† How It Works

1. User calls the **Perplexity Sonar API** to retrieve trending news topics.
2. Sonar returns:
   - A list of **keywords** (used as the hidden words in the puzzle)
   - A **clue** for each word (displayed as a hint)
   - A short **explanation** of the news context
   - A **category** (e.g., *political*, *economic*, etc.)
3. The game dynamically:
   - Builds a playable word search grid with the keywords
   - Links each word to its clue and explanation
   - Difficulty levels increase after every win
